GMNotify: A notification script for Irssi.  When away, sends an email on channel highlights/PMs.  Supports responding.
Version: 1.1
Author: Zach Walton

Parts of this script are modified from sumeet's goobtown.pl and drano's notify.io script.

--------------------------------

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

It is NOT OPTIONAL to configure gmnotify.conf.  See gmnotify.conf for an example.  The below variables should only be modified from within Irssi with /set after the script is already loaded.

--Irssi Environment Variables:
	gmnotify_poll_rate: 		How often to poll for new emails in seconds.
					Default: 300 seconds.  Setting this too low can cause freezing/crashing!
	gmnotify_active_poll_rate:	When an email is sent or received, gmnotify_poll_rate
					temporarily changes to this value.  Again, don't set this too low.
	gmnotify_source:		Gmail address to send from (blank by default!)
	gmnotify_password:		Password for address in gmail_notify_source (blank by default!)
	gmnotify_dest:			Gmail address to send to (blank by default!)
	gmnotify_folder:		The IMAP folder to poll for response emails.  This needs to be
					created as a label in the gmnotify_source address.  Add a filter
					to store all incoming emails from gmnotify_dest in this folder. 

The gmnotify.conf variables correspond to Irssi's environment variables as follows:

IMAPPollRate: gmnotify_poll_rate
TempIMAPPollRate: gmnotify_active_poll_rate
SourceEmail: gmnotify_source
SourcePassword: gmnotify_password
DestEmail: gmnotify_dest
IMAPFolder: gmnotify_folder

After upgrading the configuration file appropriately, make sure you have the correct packages installed:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install Email::Send::Gmail'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Email::Simple::Creator'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::IMAP::Simple::SSL'

After that, you should be able to load the script in Irssi with:

/script load gmnotify.pl

--------------------------------

KNOWN ISSUES:

- Due to a bug in NET::IMAP::Simple::seen(), the script can sometimes parse emails that have already been read, resulting in old responses being sent again.  Until this is fixed, response emails are deleted after being parsed.
